**Best**: *it's better than Bettr*
==================================

This is **Best**, it's totally not pretentious.

Our Mission Statement
---------------------
Here at **Best** we live by the simple acronym: **B2TBAT2** which stands for:
- **Be**: the state of existing
- **Better**: better than good
- **Than**: comparing two things
- **Bettr**: a *totally* real competitor that exists
- **All**: the entire
- **The**: definite article
- **Time**: a continuous series of moments perceived as time

It's a simple mission statement and our Chief Visionary, Jarrod Robinson (he's basically the Steve Jobs of incomplete fake currency betting web-apps), definitely keeps us on track.
