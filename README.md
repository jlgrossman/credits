**Best**: *it's better than Bettr*
==================================

This is **Best**, it's totally not pretentious.

Our Mission Statement
---------------------
Here at **Best** we live by the simple acronym: **B2TBAT2** which stands for:
- **Be**: the state of existing
- **Better**: better than good
- **Than**: comparing two things
- **Bettr**: a *totally* real competitor that exists
- **All**: the entire
- **The**: definite article
- **Time**: a continuous series of moments perceived as time

It's a simple mission statement and our Chief Visionary, Jarrod Robinson (he's basically the Steve Jobs of incomplete, fake-currency betting web-apps), definitely keeps us on track.

Our Philosophy
--------------
Our philosophy can easily be condensed into another elegant acronym which is **S4M2LTB** meaning: 

Syngergistic SaaS Solutions Should Make My Life The *Best*

We think that one is pretty self explanatory.  Our Chief Visionary came up with that acronym, so thank him for that beauty.

Corporate Jargon
----------------
At **Best**, we are committed to corporate jargon.  We believe that jargon is the key to transform a group of passionate engineers into a true organization.  That is why we practice what we preach.  For every word of corporate jargon you donate to the charity of your choice, we will donate half a word (limited to 10 words per charity).  No need to thank us :)
